# Melody Mixer Network

Melody Mixer Network offers a unique platform for radio show hosts to curate engaging music shows with rich vocal interludes. Once a show is curated and approved, it streams on a community internet radio station and is featured on the Alpine Groove Guide, a local events calendar for the Colorado Springs community.

## Project Spec
After Creating [Alpine Groove Guide ](https://github.com/rpoole444/cos-livewire-fe), a community events calendar, I realized it was time to take this a step further. In Colorado Springs the Public Radio stations have allowed AI to choose the music that is aired, instead of real live radio show hosts, so this is my answer to what a community radio broadcast should sound like to the public, and including the tastes and creative inputs of our community voices. 

## Abstract 

Melody Mixer Network allows radio show hosts to seamlessly create personalized profiles and radio shows by mixing tracks and recording vocal segments. The interface supports direct MP3 uploads and live voice recordings. Once the shows are curated and approved, they are continuously streamed on our Alpine Groove Guide, providing a constant mix of music and talk for the Colorado Springs local community.

## Learning Goals

- Implement advanced React patterns using Next.js
- Explore real-time data management with GraphQL and React Query
- Enhance UX with Edge.js for optimized content delivery
- Develop robust client-side handling with TypeScript
